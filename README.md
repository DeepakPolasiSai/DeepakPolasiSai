What up (HIMYM reference)

Welcome to my little planet of the internet galaxy! I'm Deepak, your friendly full-time gamer and part-time Full-stack developer.

A bit about me:
- Superpower: Turning Coke and snacks into code and bottom frag in Valorant.
- Special Skills:
  - Overthinking
  - Making semicolons behave (most of the time).
  - Bottom Fragging
  - Debugging at 3 AM with the power of sheer will and copious amounts of caffeine.
- Hobbies:
  - Crafting elegant solutions to ugly problems.
  - Arguing with my puppy about the best way to optimize that one function. 
  - Adding TODOs to my code and pretending I’ll fix them later.

Fun Facts:
- Once wrote a “Hello World” program that said "Hello, World!" instead of "Segmentation fault".
- My code runs perfectly... until I hand it to the QA team. 
- Believes in the ancient wisdom: "If it compiles, it ships."

Currently working on:
- Improving my aim in Valorant and CSGO (nowadays my aim is really bad)
- World domination through clean, maintainable code.
- Building a bot to fetch me snacks during gaming nights and coding marathons. 

Feel free to dive into my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions. Let's collaborate and play FPS games together and do legendary coding projects.
